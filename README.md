# Coin-Flip
Make decisions with the flip of a coin.

App Description:

Create an app that simulates flipping a coin by generating a number (between 0 and 1) and returning an image based off of the results.

Concepts Learned:

Custom Classes, NSUserDefaults within Custom Classes, using NSTimer to generate images

My Struggles:

I don't have much experience with animations, but I wanted to simulate an animation using an NSTimer to substitute a series of images (like a flip book). I had success, although I struggled finding the best way to store and call images. I also struggled slightly with saving and setting NSUserDefaults in a custom class and the view controller - specifically with being able to see saved integers percentages when the view loads the next time the app is opened.
